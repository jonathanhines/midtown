Midtown Counselling takes several measures to protect people’s privacy and confidentiality.

We collect and document confidential and personal information for the purposes of providing services, and comply with [Ontario’s Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA), 2004](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/04p03).

We only obtain personal information from you, such as your name, phone number or e-mail address, if you supply such information (e.g. by sending us an e-mail or text message or by leaving a voice recording).

We will not trade, sell or rent your personal information. We take precautions — including administrative, technical, and physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal information when you are corresponding with us. As the security of electronic forms is never fully guaranteed, you are advised to find alternate and secure means of sharing information of a personal and/or sensitive nature instead of sending it through email, text or online forums.

We regularly review our information-handling practices. Please [contact us](/contact) if you have any questions or comments in this regard.
