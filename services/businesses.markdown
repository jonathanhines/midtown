We’re here to support your business/organization with its goals. First, we listen, then we intervene. Each group’s needs are unique. So is our programming. Perhaps you’re looking for mental health awareness and coaching, perhaps one of your members needs individual support and help navigating community services, perhaps your team suffered a crisis, loss or traumatic experience or perhaps you’re not sure what they need but you know they need support. Whatever the need, let’s chat.

### Onsite Counselling Wellness Sessions {#wellness}

This is our most valuable and cost-effective program and may be available to your business. If it would make more sense for us to come to you, we’ll do that. You provide the office space, let your staff know about the services, and we help you take care of your staff. On request

### Preferred Partner Plans {#preferred}

If you are a business or non-profit situated in the KW Midtown Area and are looking to increase supports for your employees/membership, we can help. Your community is likely already expecting and hoping you care for their health and wellness.  And, most likely, you do! Ask us about how to become a preferred partner.
