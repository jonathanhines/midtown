Relationships are really important to mental wellness. When they’re lacking connectivity, balance and conflict resolution, they lead to distress, resentment and sadness. Psychotherapists find mutual goals, pinpoint problematic patterns and improve communication, love and respect.

#### Preferred Partner Rates
{: .uppercase}

Ask your employer, church or organizational lead. We may already have a partnership. If not, speak to them or us to get one started. Most businesses and organizations want to encourage wellness in their organization, but aren’t exactly sure what’s needed nor what’s available. Or, they assume they can’t afford it. That’s where we come in. We specialize in helping businesses and organizations take care of their people in a way that suits them.

#### Financial Subsidies
{: .uppercase}

Is your financial situation such that accessing counselling would do more harm than good? Our vision is an inclusive country where free healthcare is actually free. Sadly, that’s not our reality. Let’s talk. (If our subsidy of 15% is insufficient, we recommend calling [Here 24/7](https://here247.ca/) for access to publicly funded services.)
