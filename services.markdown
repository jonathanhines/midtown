## For Individuals/Families

We’re here to support you with your goals. First, we listen, then we treat. 
Our areas of expertise include:

### Depression, Anxiety & Stress

Depression, Anxiety and Stress are powerful emotions. If they’re causing you discomfort, impeding joy and limiting personal and professional effectiveness, it’s time to act.

### Family, Parenting & Social Relationships 

Relationships are really important to mental wellness. When they’re lacking connectivity, balance and conflict resolution, they lead to distress, resentment and sadness. Psychotherapists find mutual goals, pinpoint problematic patterns and improve communication, love and respect. 

### Personal Wellness & Efficacy 

If you’re keen to boost your mental health and personal effectiveness, CONGRATULATIONS, you’re embarking on a significant journey. With professional coaching, you’ll set meaningful goals and create a path to increased confidence and effectiveness. Your future is up to You.

**\*Discounts and Subsidies**

####Preferred Partner Rates
Ask your employer, church or organizational lead. We may already have a partnership. If not, speak to them or us to get one started. Most businesses and organizations want to encourage wellness in their organization, but aren’t exactly sure what’s needed nor what’s available. Or, they assume they can’t afford it. That’s where we come in. We specialize in helping businesses and organizations take care of their people in a way that suits them.

#### Financial Subsidies
Is your financial situation such that accessing counselling would do more harm than good? Our vision is an inclusive country where free healthcare is actually free. Sadly, that’s not our reality. Let’s talk. (If our subsidy of 15% is insufficient, we recommend calling Here 24/7 for access to publicly funded services.) LINK to HERE247.ca


## For Businesses/Organizations

We’re here to support your business/organization with its goals. First, we listen, then we intervene. Each group’s needs are unique. So is our programming. Perhaps you’re looking for mental health awareness and coaching, perhaps one of your members needs individual support and help navigating community services, perhaps your team suffered a crisis, loss or traumatic experience or perhaps you’re not sure what they need but you know they need support. Whatever the need, let’s chat.

#### Onsite Counselling Wellness Sessions
This is our most valuable and cost-effective program and may be available to your business. If it would make more sense for us to come to you, we’ll do that. You provide the office space, let your staff know about the services, and we help you take care of your staff. On request

#### Preferred Partner Plans
If you are a business or non-profit situated in the KW Midtown Area and are looking to increase supports for your employees/membership, we can help. Your community is likely already expecting and hoping you care for their health and wellness.  And, most likely, you do! Ask us about how to become a preferred partner.
