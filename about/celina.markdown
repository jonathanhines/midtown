Hello! My name is Celina. 

I’m an attentive listener and skilled provider of occupational therapy services. I’m registered with the [Ontario College of Occupational Therapist](https://www.coto.org/) and have extensive experience working with motor vehicle accident survivors. 

My goal is to assist you in your recovery and eventual return to meaningful activity. I have expertise in hospital discharge planning, assessment of your in home functioning, and functioning in the community and workplace. I provide equipment recommendations and client centred intervention to help you maximize your participation in roles that are important to you. My role as your occupational therapist involves working with you and your health care team to assist you achieve your rehabilitation goals. 

I earned my Masters in Occupational Therapy from McMaster University and have completed post – graduate continuing education in ergonomics, cognitive assessment and rehabilitation, concussion treatment, and pain management. 

Personally, I am finding my way through life as a mother of a two year old boy. I enjoy the outdoors, exercising (though it’s been a challenge getting back into it), and spending time with my family. I have a supportive husband, who is also a chef and has inspired me to become a food connoisseur. I have found the pandemic challenging personally and professionally, but I hope better days are ahead. I look forward to someday traveling again.
