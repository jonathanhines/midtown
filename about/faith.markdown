Faith is an important part of my life and as such, part of me and everything I do. 

I worship and serve in ministry at Highland Church in Kitchener-Waterloo, have theological training at both bachelor and master's levels, and am involved in various faith ministries in Kitchener-Waterloo. But, that doesn't tell the whole story. To do that, would take more than a webpage. 

In short, I believe God is good, gracious and able; I believe humans are just as much spirtual beings as physical beings; I believe justice, truth and love are real and to be cherished and pursued. 

Most likely, you already know your therapist won't have the exact same values and views as you. However, if it's important to you to have a Christian counsellor or person of faith, that's understandable. Send me an [email](mailto:shelly@midtowncounselling.ca) or [call](tel:2263133335) me and we can talk more about this. 

Also, I believe in the healing power of local faith communities and support collaborative initiatives of prayer and care. Many faith groups are now championing mental health awareness and advocacy. That's great and I help where I can, speaking to small groups and congregations and offering individual consultation to leaders. Send me an [email](mailto:shelly@midtowncounselling.ca) or [call](tel:2263133335) me if you'd like to consult on an issue pertaining to your congregation, have an event in mind, or would like to partner together toward community resilience.

I'm also excited to see faith groups working together toward mental wellness. Midtown Counselling hosts a local faith collaborative of clergy and other faith leaders in Kitchener-Waterloo's midtown area. Together, Midtown Counselling alongside with Glen Acres Baptist Church, Northside Community Church, Elevation Church, Trillium Lutheran Church, Calvary Memorial United Church, Parkminister United Church, Grace Lutheran Church and Dr. Larry Kelly are promoting mental health awareness and wellness in our shared neighbourhoods. Send me an [email](mailto:shelly@midtowncounselling.ca) or [call](tel:2263133335) me if you would like to join Midtown Churches & Mental Health Collaborative or would like more information.
