We look forward to the day when full inclusion is an assumption rather than an exception. Till then, it bears saying that Midtown Counselling affirms that all peoples, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender, race, culture, religion and faith are to be welcomed and treated with dignity and respect.

If you have specific questions or comments about Midtown's commitment to diversity and inclusion, or if something in our website or practice has caused offense, please [let us know](mailto:admin@midtowncounselling.ca). 

Perhaps you're wondering why, of all the forms of diversity we could explicitly reference, we specifically include the LGBTQ+ flag symbol on our website. That's a fair question. We've done so on account of the prevalence of homophobia and discrimination toward those identifying with non-traditional sexual and gender identities. 

For related facts and figures, please check-out [OECD's Society at a Glance LGBTQ+ Summary Sheet](https://www.oecd.org/media/oecdorg/directorates/directorateforemploymentlabourandsocialaffairs/socialpolicy/Spotlight-on-LGBT-web.png).
