If your injuries are complex, you'll need Occupational Therapy (OT). Occupational Therapists look at the whole of you - your life at home, at work or school, and in the community - and coordinate your treatment efforts. They provide rehabilitation coaching, help you access needed equipment, provide referrals to other specialists. 

Occupational Therapists are the quarterbacks of the MVA world - they make sure you and your health care team maximize your recovery potential.
