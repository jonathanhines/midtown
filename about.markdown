Midtown combines the science of psychosocial health with the healing capacity of therapeutic connection.

As for **science**, the field of mental health has come a long way in understanding how the brain functions, what motivates us as humans, and how to change unhelpful patterns that rob us of our capacity to enjoy life, act with confidence, and meaningfully engage with others.  Midtown’s clinicians are highly trained in evidenced-based treatment modalities that are backed by science, recommended by physicians and preferred by major treatment centres and clients alike.

As for **connection**, all psychotherapy interventions rely heavily on a good client-therapist relationship. This is of utmost importance at Midtown. In addition to the specialized training above, Midtown’s clinicians excel at tuning into clients’ strengths, values and needs so clients can be understood, inspired and empowered to pursue the changes they desire. Depending on your needs and circumstances, Midtown may also offer help improving your connection with other key people in your life, be they your children, partner, parents, neighbours, colleagues or boss.

Last, but certainly not least, Midtown is on a mission to strengthen communities. Through partnerships with local businesses, faith groups and community services, Midtown helps neighbours attend to psychological health at both individual and communal levels.

## About Shelly

<img src="/assets/images/shelly-1.jpg" alt="" class="image-float float-left">

Hello and welcome! My name is Shelly and I’m a psychotherapist and Registered Social Worker with the College of Social Workers. 

Personally, I’m an outdoor enthusiast and I love bikes – I think they’re great for people and neighbourhoods. My biking life started in my 30s just as I was recovering from an illness that left me in bed for months and messed up my endocrine system. By God’s grace and with the help of medical providers, friends, family, prayer and my church community, I recovered. Slowly.  During that time, I learned at a deeply personal level about the mind-body connection and also that weakness and dependence needn’t be feared. Biking reminds me of all that. You’ll find me cycling around town, spring, summer, fall and winter.

Professionally, I have extensive training in complex psychological health & wellness, having worked mostly in specialized, hospital-based mental health clinics for adults, young-adults and families. My journey has since expanded to include healthcare leadership support, burnout recovery and community engagement. In short, I’m an empathetic listener, strategic coach, systems thinker and community organizer.

Educationally, I combine my master's level training with ongoing professional development. I earned my Bachelors of Art & Science from McMaster University, my Masters in Social Work from Wilfred Laurier University, and have extensive postgraduate training and clinical experience in community and hospital treatment. I am a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist (CBT), and integrate techniques from Mindfulness Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), MultiSystemic Therapy (MST), Attachment & Family Systems Therapies, and trauma informed care.

## About the Midtown Community

Collaborations include running community education events, leadership forums, and offering no-charge consultations and services to those in need.

While there are so many opportunities for awesome partnerships in Kitchener-Waterloo, Midtown has retained its unique neighbourhood-specific focus. If you’re looking to partner toward improved wellness for the area, [let’s chat](/contact)!
