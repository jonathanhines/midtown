We combine the science of psycho-social health with the healing capacity of connection and the resourcefulness of communities.

As for **SCIENCE**, the field of mental health has come a long way in understanding how the brain functions, what motivates us, and how to change unhelpful patterns. Our clinicians are highly trained in evidenced-based modalities that are recommended by physicians and preferred by major treatment centres. We use science to boost your capacity to enjoy life, act with confidence, and effectively engage with others.

As for **CONNECTION**, psychotherapy gains rely heavily on strong client-therapist connectivity. Our clinicians excel at tuning into your strengths, values and needs so you can be understood, inspired and empowered to move forward. Often, therapy also improves connection with key people in your life, be they your children, partner, parents, friends, colleagues or boss.

Lastly, Midtown cares about **STRONG COMMUNITIES**. Through partnerships with local businesses, faith groups and community services, we help neighbours attend to psychological health at individual AND communal levels.

## The Midtown Community

<img src="/assets/images/hiking.jpg" alt="" class="image-float float-left"> The Midtown Community is alive, well and growing. We have partnerships with faith communities, hospitals and post-secondary institutions, and local businesses for the purpose of mental health advocacy, education and capacity building. 

Collaborations include running community events, awareness initiatives leadership forums, and offering no-charge consultations to clergy and employers, and individual services to those in need.

While there are an unlimited number of opportunities for creative partnerships in Kitchener-Waterloo, we have retained our unique neighbourhood-specific commitment. If you’re looking for help building community resilience in the KW Midtown area, [contact Shelly](mailto:shelly@midtowncounselling.ca).

On the topic of identity and geography, this community is situated on the Haldimand Tract, land that was promised to the Haudenosaunee of the Six Nations of the Grand River, and are within the territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabe, and Haudenosaunee peoples.
