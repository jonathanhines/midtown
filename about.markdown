We combine the science of psycho-social health with the healing capacity of connection and the resourcefulness of communities.

As for **SCIENCE**, the field of mental health has come a long way in understanding how the brain functions, what motivates us, and how to change unhelpful patterns. Our clinicians are highly trained in evidenced-based modalities that are recommended by physicians and preferred by major treatment centres. We use science to boost your capacity to enjoy life, act with confidence, and effectively engage with others.

As for **CONNECTION**, psychotherapy gains rely heavily on strong client-therapist connectivity. Our clinicians excel at tuning into your strengths, values and needs so you can be understood, inspired and empowered to move forward. Often, therapy also improves connection with key people in your life, be they your children, partner, parents, friends, colleagues or boss.

Lastly, Midtown cares about **STRONG COMMUNITIES**. Through partnerships with local businesses, faith groups, and community services, we help neighbours attend to psychological health at individual AND communal levels.

## About Shelly Pavlić {#shelly}

Hello! My name is Shelly. 

I’m an empathetic listener, strategic coach, systems thinker and community organizer. I’m also a **[Registered Social Worker and Psychotherapist with the Ontario College of Social Workers](https://www.ocswssw.org/)**. I have extensive training in complex psychological health & wellness, having worked mostly in specialized, hospital-based mental health clinics for adults, young-adults and families. My journey has since expanded to include healthcare leadership support, burnout recovery and community engagement.

I am a **Cognitive Behavioural Therapist (CBT)**, and integrate techniques from **Mindfulness Therapy, Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT), MultiSystemic Therapy (MST), Attachment & Family Systems Therapies, and trauma informed care**. I earned my Bachelors of Art & Science from McMaster University, my Masters in Social Work from Wilfred Laurier University for which I received Social Science and Humanities Research Council, SSHRC, recognition, and have extensive postgraduate training and clinical experience in community and hospital treatment. 

There's more to me, of course. I’m an **outdoor enthusiast and I love to bike**. My biking addiction started in my 30s just as I was recovering from an illness that left me virtually bedridden for months and exhausted my endocrine system. My journey back to health was long and tedious, involving medical providers, family, friends, prayer and patience. During that time, I learned about the mind-body connection and also that weakness and dependence needn’t be feared. Biking reminds me of all that. You’ll find me cycling around Kitchener-Waterloo, spring, summer, fall and winter, sometimes with a kid in tow, sometimes on my own.

I have a supportive partner and a cool kid. 

I've found Covid personally exhausting and can't wait for this to be over. 

Is there something else you'd like to know about me? [Just ask](mailto:shelly@midtowncounselling.ca).

## About the Midtown Community

<img src="/assets/images/hiking.jpg" alt="" class="image-float float-right"> The Midtown Community is alive, well and growing. We have partnerships with several faith communities and local businesses for the purpose of mental health advocacy, education and capacity building. 

Collaborations include running community events, awareness initiatives leadership forums, and offering no-charge consultations to clergy and employers, and individual services to those in need.

While there are an unlimited number of opportunities for creative partnerships in Kitchener-Waterloo, we have retained our unique neighbourhood-specific commitment. If you’re looking for help building community resilience in the KW Midtown area, [contact Shelly](mailto:shelly@midtowncounselling.ca).

On the topic of identity and geography, this community is situated on the Haldimand Tract, land that was promised to the Haudenosaunee of the Six Nations of the Grand River, and are within the territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabe, and Haudenosaunee peoples.
