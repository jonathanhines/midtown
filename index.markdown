### Relational Focus

What really sets us apart is our emphasis on human relations. We firmly believe effective psychotherapy necessitates a solid therapeutic connection. We invest heavily in relationship building. For starters, we encourage people to be picky about their therapists – a good fit is a must-have for effective therapy. Secondly, we’re out and about in the community often, getting to know you, being available for you, and being accountable to you. Thirdly, we provide initial consults at no cost to give you and us the chance to talk through your situation and consider the options before making any assumptions about how we can help.

Strong relationships pay off! They help us listen better and they ensure your interests are our priority… every moment of *every* session.
