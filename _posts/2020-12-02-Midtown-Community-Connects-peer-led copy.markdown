**Midtown Community Connects** Midtown counselling is proud to announce the continuation of this weekly public community group, newly under full peer-led direction. (This is an extension of Midtown Counselling's **Surviving Covid as a Community, 3 Part Series**, and is being posted on the group's behalf). This is a distanced, outdoor event, committed to following safety guidelines, including remaining within Public Health gathering limits. The small eclectic group meets at Cafe Pyrus' Outpost Thursdays at 7pm weekly for one hour.
